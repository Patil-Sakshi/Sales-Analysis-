# Sales-Analysis Dashboard

Diwali is one of the biggest shopping seasons in India, where customers tend to make high-volume purchases across various product categories. Businesses often launch special campaigns and discounts during this time. However, without analyzing the sales data, it is difficult to identify which products, customer segments, or regions are contributing the most to revenue.


The main objective of this project was to analyze Diwali sales data to understand customer purchasing behavior, identify top-performing product categories, and derive actionable insights that can support business strategies such as targeted marketing and inventory planning.
